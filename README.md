✅ Conclusion

The Tobacco Use and Mortality Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of tobacco’s impact on health and economy. It clearly shows how smoking prevalence has reduced over time due to government policies, rising prices, and medical interventions. Mortality and hospital admissions strongly correlate with smoking behavior, while prescription analysis highlights efforts to curb tobacco usage. These insights can help in policy-making, healthcare planning, and awareness campaigns.
